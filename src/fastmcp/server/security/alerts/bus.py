"""Central event bus for SecureMCP security alerts.

The ``SecurityEventBus`` is the core pub/sub hub. Components emit events
via ``emit()``, and subscribers receive events that match their filters.

Example::

    bus = SecurityEventBus()

    # Subscribe with a filter
    bus.subscribe(
        handler=my_handler,
        event_filter=SeverityFilter(min_severity=AlertSeverity.WARNING),
    )

    # Components emit events
    bus.emit(SecurityEvent(
        event_type=SecurityEventType.DRIFT_DETECTED,
        severity=AlertSeverity.WARNING,
        layer="reflexive",
        message="Drift detected",
    ))

    All SecureMCP components can emit events to the bus, and external

    Handlers should be fast; long-running work should be offloaded.
